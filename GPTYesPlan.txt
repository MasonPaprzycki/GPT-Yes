the purpose of this program is to bypass ai detection software 

program framework:
    1. the program will take input from the user 

    2. the program will process that input into a randomized translation of it translation meaning that it will retain the same data but be worded in a different way. 
    the program will avoid changing all types of words that should not be changed. 
    These synonyms will be retrieved through a english dictionary database currently groupdocs database is being used.

    this randomness will be achieved through user random entry in which text will be mapped to a value to cycle through returned synonyms 


    3. the program will check the grammer of this randomized translation using a grammer api 
    it is still unknown how this will be done 


notes:
    1. the program needs a simple UI

    2.in the future the program could automatically grab api responses to be just about fully autonomous. 

    3. the development of this program needs to be documented and reported 

    4. there is copyright citing issues that must be resolved
